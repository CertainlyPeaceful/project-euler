# My solutions to Project Euler
## A little about me!
> We have to learn to walk before we can run.

I am a novice programmer trying to improve at using C++. I realized that what I have learned in class is insufficient in many ways, so I have decided to supplement my *knowledge* and *experience* in coding by using online resources and applying them. When I work through each problems, I will have to be careful with the algorithm and such. Consequently, this will help me solidify my fundamentals!
## What is [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)?
> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
## Notes and comments
I am simply using this repository to mark my progress and keep track of my progress. Furthermore, by tackling this challenge, I will be able to learn *new* mathematical concepts and apply to a limited degree.
